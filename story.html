        <p>...wait, <em>what</em>?!</p>

        <p>"You see, Shuppet feeds off of negative emotions. And Shuppy here has been an extra-good boy recently, so I
            thought I'd give him a little treat! I'm sure the teams will be back to normal as soon as he eats up all
            that anger."</p>

        <p>You stand there, dumbfounded and completely speechless. So <em>that</em> was the point of all this work? That
            was the ulterior motive behind this citywide rampage? As you process this, Giovanni starts making baby talk
            at the Shuppet.</p>

        <p>Noticing your expression, he asks with a frown, "Hm? Is something wrong?"</p>

        <p>"No, nothing at all! See you tomorrow, boss." you hastily respond, turning around and walking out the door.
        </p>

        <center>
            <p>* * *</p>
        </center>

        <p>...well, that's that. So you didn't quite orchestrate a strategic destabilization of regional forces for
            nefarious world domination purposes. But you did feed a happy Shuppet! And tomorrow, the sun will still
            shine and the leaves will still float along the gentle morning breeze, and the world will still be the same
            glorious world to explore.</p>

        <p>And maybe that's all that matters?</p>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk">
        <p>At last, the moment you've been waiting for! You enter Giovanni's top-floor executive office and find him
            working at his desk, a Shuppet floating around the room above him. Giovanni looks up from his desk, and
            you're sure you sense approval in his eyes.</p>

        <p>"So, boss, it's done!"</p>

        <p>"Excellent!", he replies. "Now, come, take a look out this window." You peek through the curtains at the
            chaos that has erupted on the streets. "If you look carefully, you'll notice something&mdash;the teams'
            tactics you learned earlier seem to have something more to them."</p>

        <p>You respond: "So, what next? Will this help us break apart the teams so we can take them on individually? Or
            are we going to let them weaken each other so we can take over in the chaos?" You pause, waiting for him to
            <a href="puzzle/a-turn-for-the-worse.html">reveal his master plan...</a></p>

        <p>"<b>RUN RIOT</b>, eh? I like the sound of that!" Spark flashes you a grin. "Maybe it's time to remind Candela
            how we deal with things around here!"</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    

    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk">
        <p>You've gained the trust of Spark! He seems to be fretting about Candela. Go <a

        <p>"<b>BLAST AC</b>? That is certainly one way to resolve our problem." Blanche considers your proposition for a
            moment. "Very well. We shall relax in the cool air while we forcibly destroy their power supply."</p>

        <p>You've gained the trust of Blanche! Looks like she's a little concerned about Spark. Go <a

        <p>"<b>INFER NO</b>? Well, if they're gonna keep up this frosty facade, maybe I'll have to melt right through
            it." Candela nods at you. "Thanks. It's time Blanche felt some heat."</p>

        <p>You've gained the trust of Candela! She appears kind of upset at Blanche. Go <a

        <p>Oh, of course, <b>ROCKETEERING</b>! You reach into your backpack to make sure your Rocket uniform's still
            neatly folded in there, while Giovanni continues to talk over the phone.</p>

        <p>"...foster mutual distrust between the three Teams' leaders, leading to an unprecedented shift in power
            dynamics. You got all that?" He doesn't wait for a reply. "Of course, you'll need to gain an audience with
            the leaders first. See if you can infiltrate their teams and help out their lackeys. I have a feeling
            they'll be interested in a newly recruited upstart who can help them solve Puzzl&eacute;stops... from what
            I've observed, they're rather lacking in that department."</p>

        <p>Well, looks like the time's finally come! It's now or never, so get your uniform on and <a
                href="puzzles.html">get out there</a>!</p>

        <p>You're having fun walking in all directions across the city grid, when suddenly your phone rings! You
            straighten up as you hear the unmistakable voice of your team leader themselves.</p>

        <p>"Hope your preparation's going well, agent. Remember that this is a game of strategy and territory, and it's
            only through strategy that man has been able to triumph over machine. Get ready for the alpha stage of your
            mission!"</p>

        <p>Oh, right, your mission. Um, <a href="puzzle/getting-going.html">what were you supposed to be doing again</a>?

        <p>It's another cool, bright day out, perfect for traipsing around the neighborhood. As you pack your team
            attire into your backpack, you make a note of all the places you plan to hit up for the day. Maybe today's
            the day your hard work will finally earn your team leader's attention!</p>

        <p>As you step out and turn the corner, a group of Puzzl&eacute;stops peeks into view. Well, best <a
