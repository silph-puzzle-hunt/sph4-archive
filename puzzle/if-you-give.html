<p>...your (A, B), he'll appreciate the opportunity to relax. After all, he and your aunt have been taking care of you 24/7
while your parents have been away.</p>
<p>...(C, D), he'll probably have trouble convincing Aunt Polly to let him keep it. But if she does, maybe he and Huck can
become birdkeepers one day.</p>
<p>...a (E, F), he'll probably love spending time in it. He'll tell you something like, "Duuude! Thank you so much, this
man cave is super sick!"</p>
<p>...a (G, H), he'll try it on. If it's the right size for his body, he'll wear it regularly, at least when it's warm
enough for short sleeves.</p>
<p>...(I, J), I'll probably be confused. "Did you find this in a tree somewhere?" I might ask you. "Why are you stealing
from birds? Go put it back!"</p>
<p>...a (K, L), it'll probably ask you to pour it into its water bowl. Then it'll lap it up. It might complain about the
fizziness or the bitterness, though.</p>
<p>...a (M, N), it'll probably be in pain. It might even be poisoned. If the mother ewe is nearby, she might become
aggressive towards you.</p>
<p>...(O, P), she'll want to call or text her friends to hang out. She'll probably start spending even less time around
Stewie and Chris.</p>
<p>...(Q, R), you might find that you like it more than AGT or Voice. You might even decide to audition yourself!</p>
<p>...your (S, T), you’ll have a pretty unique hairstyle. Those waves and those bleached white locks will definitely stand
out in a crowd.</p>
