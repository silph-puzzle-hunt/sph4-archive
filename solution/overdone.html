    <p>This puzzle is about mangled clues. Solvers are given eight mangled clues; as is typical of the genre, we can figure out the way each word is transformed, and solve the original clues:</p>
<p>Mangled clue: ABLECRAF MI  AFTSMINE STRYGEND DM DU   NTERIMPR SIDEALON ARELAB<br />
Transformation: remove the central letter or letters, and swap the two remaining halves around<br />
Original clue: CRAFTABLE ITEM IN MINECRAFTS GENDUSTRY MOD USED IN AN IMPRINTER ALONGSIDE LABWARE &#8594; GENETIC TEMPLATE</p>
<p>Mangled clue: ALB ERENNIAB RASI ROF ROWD OMMERCIALLO OH UCROSU<br />
Transformation: shift the last letter by -10, and delete the first letter<br />
Original clue: TALL PERENNIAL GRASS CROP GROWN COMMERCIALLY FOR SUCROSE &#8594; SUGARCANE</p>
<p>Mangled clue: CPIM YJOS VKTL KU UQMETIME VTANSLATE CU IJOSTOR<br />
Transformation: shift each of the first two letters by +2, and delete the last letter<br />
Original clue: ANIME WHOSE TITLE IS SOMETIMES TRANSLATED AS GHOSTORY &#8594; BAKEMONOGATARI</p>
<p>Mangled clue: ESRISTANCE NIUTS ERPHAPS<br />
Transformation: move the first letter into the third position<br />
Original clue: RESISTANCE UNITS PERHAPS &#8594; OHMS</p>
<p>Mangled clue: SWT WDROW KNIDECERP VONOH VO WNAELRO<br />
Transformation: shift the last letter by +4, then reverse<br />
Original clue: TWO WORDS PRECEDING HONOR OR ORLEANS &#8594; MAID OF</p>
<p>Mangled clue: THREJ WORH EXPRFSIOR MEANJK TS WASTJ TIMI CREAUNK SOMEUINK ALREBC IR EXISUNCI<br />
Transformation: shift the fifth letter by +1, then the last letter by +4, then delete the sixth letter<br />
Original clue: THREE WORD EXPRESSION MEANING TO WASTE TIME CREATING SOMETHING ALREADY IN EXISTENCE &#8594; REINVENT THE WHEEL</p>
<p>Mangled clue: TOKO RAI STAION SEQENTALL BETEEN HINDE AND ODABAKIHIKOE<br />
Transformation: delete every fourth letter<br />
Original clue: TOKYO RAIL STATION SEQUENTIALLY BETWEEN HINODE AND ODAIBAKAIHINKOEN &#8594; SHIBAURA-FUTO</p>
<p>Mangled clue: UL AM  NGLIS ILLAG OM  H OYA ORSESHOE N<br />
Transformation: delete the first and last letters<br />
Original clue: FULL NAME OF ENGLISH VILLAGE HOME TO THE ROYAL HORSESHOES INN &#8594; WALTHAM ON THE WOLDS</p>
<p>The usual next step in mangled clues puzzles is to re-encode the resultant answers into something of note. However, re-encoding our answers doesn't seem to give anything useful.</p>
<p>Instead, solvers need to realize that they must perform the re-encoding step multiple times in order to get answers that they can use. Some possible ways solvers might figure this out are by noticing that transforming OHMS once gives HMOS, which is just one step away from the suspiciously puzzly MOHS, or perhaps by interpreting the title creatively. Regardless, transforming some clues should confirm this idea. After some number of transformations, each answer turns into a recognizable word.</p>

<p>Two observations can be made here: first, each final answer represents an ordered set of things, so we can take the <em>n</em>-th item of that set, where we made <em>n</em> transformations to the original answer. Secondly, the transforms are consecutive numbers from 2 to 9, which also provides an ordering on our items.</p>
<p>Finally, we can apply the indices at the bottom of the puzzle to index into our items for the final answer <strong>YEARNING</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>While writing for this hunt, I spent a while deliberately thinking about well-established puzzle types and how I could put a fresh spin on them; the results were this puzzle and <a href="../puzzle/cyclic">Cyclic</a>. I wasn't super sure whether this idea would be interesting or feasible at first, but finding the transformation from BAKEMONOGATARI to POKEMON convinced me to go all the way with it. REINVENT THE WHEEL to REINDEER was a complete stroke of luck that resulted from me going through lots of phrases that shared prefixes with REINDEER, and shows that with the power of Caesar shifts, anything is possible.</p>
