<p>Solving some rebuses might help solvers to conclude they are sorted in alphabetical order by answer, which should help with the remaining rebuses. After some research, solvers may realise these are all Olympic athletes; in particular, they all have medals in two Olympic sports. The blanks at the bottom of the puzzle act as confirmation, as the sports all fit in alphabetic order.</p>
<p>The diagram has 13 nodes, the same as the number of sports, and 19 lines, the same as the number of athletes solvers identify by solving the rebuses. If we model each athlete as a line connecting the two nodes representing the sports they received medals in, we can uniquely match athletes to lines and sports to nodes via the diagram's structure. For example, there are only two nodes with a single connection; these must be either "Equestrian" or "Skeleton", which can be disambiguated by the fact that "Equestrian" connects to "Gymnastics", which has four connections, and "Skeleton" connects to "Bobsleigh", which has two connections. After solving the grid with similar deductions, solvers may index into the sports with the given numbers. Doing so yields the phrase ANSWER RUNNERS reading left-to-right separately across the top and bottom of the diagram, so the answer to this puzzle is <b>RUNNERS</b>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>I had this idea written deep in my puzzle-ideas.txt file (it's not actually a txt file, but don't tell anyone), and when I realized I could call it "Closing Ceremony" to go along with "Opening Ceremony" and have it as the finisher of the Round 1 puzzles, I thought that was pretty cool and thought it made it worth writing a rather simpler dataset puzzle. (Plus, we were a bit short on ideas to fill all the feeder slots at that point.) Of course, this puzzle isn't titled "Closing Ceremony"... what happened was that lovemathboy pointed out, astutely, that having the first Round 1 puzzle have "Opening" in the title and the last have "Closing" in the title could be somewhat red-herring-y for the meta, which does not have the strongest ordering in the world. Hence, I suggested switching the title to Medal Ceremony, and coming up with a Round 2 idea to be titled "Closing Ceremony" just so we could have all three in the hunt, because that'd have been pretty cool! However, this was noticed pretty close to the hunt's actual date, so I couldn't come up with any good ideas in time. So that's why we have an Opening and Medal Ceremony, but no Closing Ceremony!</p>
<p>As for the puzzle itself, it had to be nerfed a bit from its original incarnation, such as by tweaking overly difficult rebuses. There's also a lot of confusion between Olympic sports, disciplines, and events, along with the fact that "Art Competitions" aren't really a sport, but they did give out medals. I thought including the blanks&mdash;which the puzzle didn't originally have&mdash;could help, especially since this is a Round 1 puzzle. I <em>think</em> it's possible to cheese the puzzle without the blanks, and <em>especially</em> with them, if a solver knew exactly what they were doing, though I would imagine that would be pretty hard with just the title to go off. But I think just normally solving the rebuses straight up is probably easier and faster... if you jumped all these hurdles and performed all these mental gymnastics to solve the puzzle without solving a single rebus, I applaud you! Here's a medal for you: üèÖ</p>
