<p>Solvers will open the puzzle to some circles, and some colored lines going through the circles, as well as black curved
lines connecting some of the circles. While this can be interpreted in a lot of ways, the intended thing to do was to
read these as "COLOR WORD" phrases, such as RED HERRING. And the curved lines means two letters are the same. This is
how the puzzle solves:</p>
<ul>
<li>BLACK / GREEN <strong>B</strong>ELT</li>
<li>PINK / WHITE E<strong>L</strong>EPHANT</li>
<li>BLACK / PINK P<strong>A</strong>NTHER</li>
<li>BLUE / GREEN / SILVER SCREE<strong>N</strong></li>
<li>BLUE / GRAY / RED / SILVER / GREEN BAC<strong>K</strong></li>
<li>PURPLE / RED / YELLOW E<strong>M</strong>PEROR</li>
<li>GREEN / WHITE HOUS<strong>E</strong></li>
<li>BLACK / BLUE / RED / WHITE / YELLOW FL<strong>A</strong>G</li>
<li>BROWN / GREEN / YELLOW HOR<strong>N</strong>ET</li>
<li>BLACK / RED / SCARLET LE<strong>T</strong>TER</li>
<li>BLACK / GREEN / LIME / RED / WHITE L<strong>I</strong>GHT</li>
<li>BLACK / PINK <strong>M</strong>ONEY</li>
<li>WINE / YELLOW PR<strong>E</strong>SS</li>
</ul>
<p>Extracting to BLANK MEAN TIME, which clues <strong>GREENWICH</strong>, the answer!</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>I wasn't a big fan of how this one turned out... the idea of a wordless word puzzle seemed alluring, and making use of interesting "COLOR WORD" phrases that took on different meanings when you changed the color (as opposed to something like BLUE / WHITE NILE) was something that sparked some interest in me. All in all, though, this wasn't very signposted by the puzzle, which led both to a lot of frustration by solvers (and later by me) as well as to this puzzle being the least solved R1 puzzle, which is a shame. Most of all, I really didn't enjoy the arbitrary nature of deciding what counted and what didn't as a phrase. There's a whole sleuth of belt colors in judo and karate, say, that could have been included in this puzzle, or many other animals animed as COLOR BACK. And I can't even claim everything included are "common words or phrases", because RED / YELLOW EMPEROR or PINK MONEY, say, definitely don't fit that bill. There's a lot of things I'd have done differently in hindsight, but I hope the puzzle in the incarnation it had to be used during the hunt wasn't too bad. I didn't have much testsolving data on this one, so it was really hard to judge how hard it'd be. My apologies if this puzzle caused you to waste a hint just to break-in, or just led to frustration.</p>
<p>That aside, a thank you to Deusovi for helping me come up with some COLOR WORDs for the fill. Also, I really wanted the cluephrase to be LONDON BOROUGH, but sadly, REDBRIDGE exists (and even the length is the same), so I had to settle with this less interesting cluephrase.</p>
