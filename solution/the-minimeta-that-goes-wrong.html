<p>As the title states, this is a minimeta that has gone a little wrong. Most of the minipuzzles cannot be solved by the regular means by which most of them are typically approached, and solvers instead have to hack out or otherwise short-circuit the puzzles.</p>
<h4>Solving the minipuzzles</h4>
<h5>Rebus</h5>
<p>Although the pictures are apparently missing, we can reconstruct what the rebus was meant to be from the alt text and the image urls. The pictures involved would have clued METROID - ID + AP + NEAPOLITAN - APNEA, giving the subpuzzle answer <strong>METROPOLITAN</strong>.</p>
<h5>Obligatory Codesheet Puzzle</h5>
<p>Astute observers may notice that this is simply Morse code, so we can pop it into a Morse code translator to get CEETTII WETT SEETVED THEEIE EETD BEAN THE SEETUTIEEN TEE THIS 5USESETE IS 5AINSTAKING TEIANSIEEII5TIEEN. So the answer is just... wait, hold on, that's not right. Okay, backing up.</p>
<p>Astute observers may notice that the author is seemingly unaware that there are multiple versions of Morse code, and may begin to suspect this is a different version from international Morse code. In fact, this is American Morse code, but all gaps of any length have been converted to single spaces and all dashes of any length have been converted to single dashes. A little bit of tweaking, keeping in mind that these should all be words, gives the interpretation JOLLY WELL SOLVED THERE OLD BEAN THE SOLUTION TO THIS PUZZLE IS PAINSTAKING TRANSCRIPTION. The answer to this subpuzzle is <strong>PAINSTAKING TRANSCRIPTION</strong>.</p>
<h5>Capital Letters</h5>
<p>Here, we observe the classic effects of a puzzle author falling victim to the oldest trick in the book: assuming uniformity in a dataset. Anyway, the puzzle mentions that the extraction is a capital city, and the answer is the country it's the capital of, but also that the country has three capitals. The only country that fits this description is <strong>SOUTH AFRICA</strong>.</p>
<h5>Word Search</h5>
<p>Although the grid is apparently missing from this word search, we're told via the to-do notes that the mechanic is to extract the first letters of the words found in the word search. In combination with the suggestion that the author isn't overlapping words in the grid, we can surmise that the actual word search step only provides an ordering for the first letters of the words we can already see. </p>
<p>Therefore, we can equivalently obtain the answer to this puzzle by randomly anagramming the first letters of the words listed. Doing just this (e.g. with this <a href="https://nutrimatic.org/?q=%3Ceeiilpprrtuzz%3E">Nutrimatic query</a>) gives the very compelling suggestion <strong>PULITZER PRIZE</strong>, which fits the note about the flavor text pun and is also, more importantly, accepted by the answer checker.</p>
<h5>Original Content</h5>
<p>This subpuzzle details the exact method of solving this puzzle, but since we don't have access to the source material, the puzzle can't be solved as intended. Instead, solvers might notice that, due to the way the puzzle mechanism works, each extracted letter must be one of the two given letters. We can write this into a <a href="https://nutrimatic.org/?q=[ah][en][sa][dw][ca][la][nm][ao][on]">Nutrimatic query</a> and extract the thematic subpuzzle answer <strong>HEADCANON</strong>.</p>
<h5>Extremely Hard Programming Puzzle</h5>
<p>Actually running this code will take a rather long time, not so much because of the code itself but because it's written in Python. However, people with a strong understanding of Computer Science, as well as people without one, can inspect this program manually to find that it simulates the Hackerman function, a little-known variant of the Ackermann function. What this function does is it prints 'THE ANSWER TO THIS SUBPUZZLE IS "HACKERMAN"'. Therefore, the answer to this subpuzzle is <strong>HACKERMAN</strong>.</p>
<h5>Einstein Puzzle</h5>
<p>Although we can figure out the relative amount of points each person scored to every other person, there's no fixed reference point to go off. However, seeing as how all we have are the numerical score values each player achieved, it's not too much of a stretch to assume that the extraction for this subpuzzle should be by A1Z26. This is confirmed by players 1 to 6 having the same relative score values as the letters in ANSWER have to each other; accordingly, setting player 1's score to 1 gives the extraction ANSWER AREPO. This subpuzzle's answer is <strong>AREPO</strong>.</p>
<h5>Text Adventure</h5>
<p>There's no actual text adventure here, unless you consider reading through this entire ramble an adventure. What we do glean from the text, however, is that the answer must be one of the eight cardinal or intercardinal directions. There's no way to tell which one it is, but since the answer checkers don't have guess limits, we can simply try all eight directions until we get the correct one, which is <strong>NORTHWEST</strong>.</p>
<h5>Error Correction</h5>
<p>Every alphabetical character in this subpuzzle has been replaced by a question mark. It's pretty much impossible to actually reconstruct the solution, but since digits are not replaced, we we can gather two pieces of information about the answer via some inferences based on what solutions usually look like.</p>
<p>The second paragraph explains how the puzzle mostly works by giving an example. We see two numbers, one factual and one erroneous; their difference is taken (thematic to the idea of "error correction"), and this is followed by the phrase "?1?26", which looks a lot like A1Z26. Since the difference was 17, we could reasonably conclude that this clue extracts a Q. "#10" suggests that this could be the 10th clue, giving the 10th letter of the answer. Additionally, the third paragraph ends in the bold sequence <strong>???? ???? ??????</strong>, likely providing the enumeration to the answer to this subpuzzle.</p>
<p>The only common phrase of the form <a href="https://onelook.com/?w=%3F%3F%3F%3F+%3F%3F%3F%3F+%3Fq%3F%3F%3F%3F&amp;ls=a">???? ???? ?q????</a> is <strong>ROOT MEAN SQUARE</strong>, which the answer checker will confirm. Note that even without the Q, there are not many phrases with enumeration (4, 4, 6), and we can simply try common ones until the answer checker accepts one.</p>
<h5>Conundrum</h5>
<p>One key realization to make in this conundrum is that none of the steps affect the first 10 plates in the row at all. Therefore, after performing all the steps (and eating way too many cherries), the first ten plates still spell out the word <strong>COMPLEXITY</strong>, the answer to this subpuzzle.</p>
<h5>Cryptarithm</h5>
<p>This "reverse cryptarithm" is basically a cryptogram with digits. Not for the first time this hunt, a cryptogram solver like <a href="https://quipqiup.com/">quipqiup</a> is helpful here; we can convert the digits into a cryptogram query like ABC DCABCEFGDHI, which returns basically only <strong>THE NETHERLANDS</strong>, which the answer checker confirms is right.</p>
<h5>Crossword</h5>
<p>This exquisitely gridded crossword is completely filled with A's. The diagonal is thus AAAAAAAAA; shifted by the given Caesar shifts and contextualized with the given enumeration, the answer is actually <strong>I CAN'T GRID</strong>. Which is the sad truth.</p>
<h4>Unlocking the metapuzzle</h4>
<p>As solvers complete minipuzzles, they will likely notice that solving a minipuzzle also causes the status of some other minipuzzles to flip: solved minipuzzles will turn unsolved, while unsolved minipuzzles will be marked as solved, with some gibberish answer. It's possible to note that these gibberish answers are actually a Caesar shift of the answer the solver has just input, though this information is not required at this stage.</p>
<p>The blurb at the top of the puzzle claims that the metapuzzle unlocks at 12 solves, and keeps track of the current number of "solves", which is really just the current number of puzzles in the "solved" state, regardless of whether they were actually solved at any point. This is in fact a variant of a Lights Out puzzle, where solving a puzzle is equivalent to toggling a light and its neighbors, though of course we can't directly interact with "lights" (puzzles) that are already "on" (solved). Either by some form of logic, manual brute force, or coding a brute force search, we can find the (unique) combination of solves that will set all the puzzles to a solved status and unlock the metapuzzle.</p>
<p>The table below shows how solving a puzzle (left) toggles other puzzles (top). In the event that a puzzle to be toggled is unsolved, the number represents the positive amount that the answer is Caesar shifted by before it is placed in the target puzzle's solution line. The combination used to unlock the minimeta is highlighted in yellow.</p>

<h4>Finishing up</h4>
<p>The metapuzzle contains 12 indices which can be used to index into the 12 puzzle answers, and some blanks providing a (2, 3, 7) enumeration. Doing the straightforward indexing provides MR RED HERRING, which is cute but quite clearly not the right answer. So what next? We've used most of the information in the puzzle, but notably the shifts have not been used yet. The idea here is that the indices in the metapuzzle could be used to index into the shifted answers spawned when each minipuzzle is solved; equivalently, one could imagine entering <em>only</em> the letters M, R, R... into the twelve boxes, applying the puzzle's shifting mechanics, and seeing what happens. The table below summarizes the letters that are extracted in this case.</p>

<p>For confirmation, the letters spawned at each puzzle agree with each other in the case of multiple other puzzles shifting letters to the same puzzle. We can read the single letter at each puzzle to get PYTRYPARTNER; this uses the same (2, 3, 7) enumeration as the fake metapuzzle, and also has a first word which is an abbreviation&mdash;in this case, we interpret it as PY TRY PARTNER, or the "partner" of the "try" keyword in Python (py). Python uses try-except blocks for error handling, so the answer is <strong>EXCEPT</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>This puzzle was built on the idea of "what if solved puzzles could unsolve themselves?". The Lights Out shell was a pretty natural way to achieve this, and I liked the idea of embedding it in an unexpected context. Originally, the plan was to fill it with trivially easy minipuzzles like the no-action Conundrum or the screaming Crossword, but after making a few, the idea of the puzzles slowly shifted towards "puzzles that must be solved in unexpected ways".</p>
<p>The sort of intricate and controlled chaos reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Play_That_Goes_Wrong">The Play That Goes Wrong</a>, which the puzzle's title references. I tried to style the humor in this puzzle after it, writing it as a set of puzzles that really wants to be taken seriously but is undermined by various "technical issues".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, more teams got stuck on the meta extraction than I had expected; I noticed that treating the puzzle structure like a directed graph probably helps in unlocking the metapuzzle, but the metapuzzle extraction harder to see, and I suspect that many teams probably did this. Another idea for the metapuzzle was to directly tell solvers to find some shortest path on the graph from puzzle A to puzzle B, with the steps on the path having Caesar shifts of +5, +22, +3, +5, +16, +20 to extract the answer. Ultimately, I discarded it because it broke the "immersion" of the minimeta being broken, but I do wonder if that was the right decision. It seems many teams had fun with this puzzle despite the slightly sticky final extraction, so I hope it wasn't too much of a downer!</p>
