    <p>This puzzle is about interpreting prefixes and suffixes "creatively" (or, as it's known in the real world, incorrectly). Each clue on the left clues a word via a root word and two in some combination of prefixes and suffixes, as shown below. Here, we denote the root word in uppercase, and the two prefixes or suffixes in lowercase.</p>

<p>These answers are in alphabetical order to aid in solving the clues, but also to indicate that they need to be reordered. These answers match the normal clues on the right hand side of the puzzle, so we can match them to the corresponding clue on the right and index into the answer by the associated numbers. (In practice, solvers are likely to break into this puzzle by solving left and right hand clues simultaneously and comparing them; pairs such as the not-not-RON and AARON are quite unambiguous and could cause the aha.)</p>

<p>Performing the described indexing yields the clue phrase MORE MORE MAGIC STICK. Together with the (8) enumeration on the puzzle page, we can determine that this is cluing one last clue; "more" quite naturally leads to the -er suffix, and we can conclude that the answer to this puzzle is <strong>WANDERER</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>This puzzle was inspired by a dream, sort of. I woke up one morning with the distinct association of DEVOTEE with the definition of "one who loses votes" in my mind, put it in my ideas spreadsheet, and went back to sleep. Later, I noticed WANDERER in the answers, and noted the idea as a definite possibility, though I was concerned that the idea might not be interesting enough for the hunt. In the end, I was won over by our need for more puzzles, but also because I thought MORE MORE MAGIC STICK was a really funny extracted phrase. Hopefully my choices of clues were enough to make the puzzle sufficiently interesting!</p>
<p>(Also, yes, the first clue is a deliberate reference to that particular Key and Peele sketch.)</p>
