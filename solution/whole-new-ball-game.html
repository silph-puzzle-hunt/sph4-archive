    <p>As hinted by "connections" in the flavortext and the 4-by-4 layout of the grids on this page, this puzzle contains 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Connect#Round_3:_Connecting_Wall">connecting walls</a>, where the goal is to find meaningful categories that separate the 16 items on each wall into four groups. However, four words on each wall are missing; after trying to find connections on some walls, solvers might be able to conclude that one item from each category is missing. Still, it's possible to determine the categories even with the missing entries. </p>
<p>After finding some connections, one natural next step might be to attempt to figure out what the missing words are. Solvers might notice that some words seemingly fit multiple categories; for example, Wall 3 contains the connection "Ed Sheeran songs", Wall 6 contains the connection "Words that form a phrase when prepended by 'swan'", and DIVE fits both. Perhaps in connection with the title and the flavortext's mention of "catch" and "rates", solvers might discover that every category can be satisfied by exactly one <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball#Types_of_Pok.C3.A9_Balls">Pok&eacute; Ball variant</a>.</p>
<h5>Wall 1</h5>

<h5>Wall 7</h5>
<p>CHANCELLOR, KING, PRESIDENT, <strong>PREMIER</strong>: Heads of state<br />

DEAR, MIDDLE EAR, QUO, <strong>HEAL</strong>: Words that can have "TH" appended to make a different word<br />
LEI, TABOO, WIKI, <strong>POKE</strong>: English words with Polynesian origins</p>
<h5>Wall 8</h5>

<p>As clued by the flavortext, the next step is to find each ball's "current best rates"&mdash;that is, find its highest catch rate multiplier under optimal circumstances in the current generation. Finally, we can add up the rate multipliers within each wall and convert them via A1Z26 to extract the answer <strong>WISE ELDERS</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>A few days into the hunt, we received a report that suggested there was an erratum in this puzzle's assumed catch rates for Safari and Sport Balls; although <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball#Types_of_Pok.C3.A9_Balls">the page</a> I referenced while writing this puzzle (and which all our testsolvers also referenced) listed their rate multipliers as 1.5, they actually had multipliers of 1 (as reflected on a <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate#Pok.C3.A9_Ball_effectiveness_rates">different page</a> about Pok&eacute; Ball catch rates). After some discussion, we decided that the erratum was impractical to fix, and that most solvers would either not be affected by it or would be able to error-correct their way to the correct answer. Another factor in this consideration was that the lack of a true canonical source on these rates made it hard to tell which page was actually correct. Apologies to all solvers who were impacted by this complication.</p>
<p>But also, really, never before have I felt so conspired against by the universe.</p>
