<p>Solvers are presented with what looks like a standard Einstein elimination logic puzzle involving 9 kids in 9 positions holding 9 numbers. Using what's given in the puzzle, solvers will probably be able to get a few steps into the logic puzzle before getting completely stuck; the logic puzzle is impossible to solve uniquely using only the given information.</p>
<p>Instead, solvers may have noticed some strange clues in the puzzle, and should follow up on these. There are nine rather specific-sounding special qualities mentioned in the puzzle (such as "fan of the MLB player nicknamed 'Flash'") that solvers might consider looking up. Indeed, the MLB player nicknamed 'Flash' is Tom Gordon, and the Stephen King book "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" is about a girl named Trisha. Another possible break-in is Lisbeth; solvers can find that the protagonist of the Millennium series, which includes The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, is named Lisbeth Salander.</p>
<p>Proceeding in this way, we can conjecture that all the "kids" mentioned in the puzzle are actually protagonists of books of the form "The Boy Who [x]" or "The Girl Who [x]". A bit of research allows us to complete our information, which gives us the following solution to the logic puzzle:</p>
<table>

<p>The fact that we're "not exactly on a first-name basis" with the kids hints that the last names are useful. Indeed, arranging the kids by position and using their held number as an index into their last name provides the answer to this puzzle, <strong>DON'T WANNA</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Logical walkthrough</h4>
<p>For this walkthrough, we assume that solvers have already figured out the links between kids and their special qualities. We'll substitute in first names for descriptions to make things easy, and label each of the given statements.</p>
<!----------- how do i make these roman numerals HELP ------------->

<ol><li>Both square numbers should be held by the kids at either end of the line.</li><li>Exactly one boy should hold an odd number.</li><li>Exactly one pair of boys should stand adjacent to each other, and exactly one pair of girls should stand adjacent to each other.</li><li>Kazuko's held number should be strictly greater than their position number.</li><li>Lisa should hold the number '6'.</li><li>Trisha should stand in position 1.</li><li>Beatrice should have a held number strictly less than their position number.</li><li>The holder of the number '5' has a position number one less than Kazuko's and one more than Beatrice's.</li><li>Conrad should hold a number equal to twice of the number held by William.</li><li>The number held by the kid at the rightmost end of the line, who isn't Kazuko, should be a multiple of a number held by a boy.</li><li>Sammy should stand immediately to the left of the kid holding the number '8'.</li><li>There are exactly three kids between Lisa and Jacob.</li></ol>

<ul>
<li>From VI and I, Trisha holds either 4 or 9. The person at the end holds the other, and from X, a boy holds their square root.  </li>
<li>Then by counting parity switches implied by III, the person at the other end is also a girl. So in fact the holders of 4 and 9 are both girls. Call this Fact A.  </li>
<li>From IX, (William, Conrad) can hold (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10).  <ul>
<li>But from V, Lisa has 6 so not the second case.  </li>
<li>And Fact A eliminates (2, 4) and (4, 8), since 4 is one of the squares.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore William holds 5 and Conrad holds 10.  </li>
<li>Now we know from VIII that Beatrice is left of William is left of Kazuko.  </li>
<li>How does this triplet interact with the Lisa---Jacob pair?<ul>
<li>As Trisha takes up spot 1, and none of {Lisa, Jacob, Kazuko} can be the square-holder at the other side (by V, Fact A, and Fact IV respectively)...  </li>
<li>There isn't enough room for them to abut,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>so they must be nested. So we have Lisa/Jacob, Beatrice, William, Kazuko, Jacob/Lisa in five spots in order.  </li>
<li>Lisbeth is the only unaccounted-for girl and must be the other squareholder.  </li>
<li>The still unaccounted-for people are Sammy and Conrad.  </li>
<li>How does XI happen? The people that Sammy could still stand to the left of are Lisa, Jacob, Conrad, and Lisbeth. Among them, only Jacob can hold 8.  </li>
<li>So we have (Sammy, Jacob, Beatrice, William, Kazuko, Lisa) all contiguous. Both same-gender pairs have been used, so Conrad is to Lisa's right, and the positions are locked down:  </li>
<li>Trisha 4/9, Sammy, Jacob 8, Beatrice, William 5, Kazuko, Lisa 6, Conrad 10, Lisbeth 4/9.  </li>
<li>We can also bound Beatrice and Kazuko's numbers to be {2,3} and {7,8,9,10}. But 8, 9, 10 are all taken so Kazuko has 7.  </li>
<li>Meanwhile, recall X; the only boy left is Sammy, who we can therefore conclude also holds 2/3 (whatever the square root of Lisbeth is).  </li>
<li>But William is the one boy who holds an odd number already; by II, no other boys can hold an odd number.  </li>
<li>So Sammy holds 2 and Lisbeth holds 4.  </li>
<li>We obtain the final arrangement: Trisha 9, Sammy 2, Jacob 8, Beatrice 3, William 5, Kazuko 7, Lisa 6, Conrad 10, Lisbeth 4.</li>
</ul>
