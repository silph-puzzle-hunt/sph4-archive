    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>This was, by a long shot, the most work I've put into constructing a puzzle. It took very long to work to manually reverse engineer a deck order that worked to turn the title into the answer when decrypted, but very thankfully, I managed to do it after about a week of working on it, almost every day! That said, I'm very happy with how this puzzle turned out. My original idea was just to use the poker part, as I had never heard of the Solitaire cipher before, but Deusovi suggested it and I immediately knew it would make for quite the final step! It seems the main concern with it is the fact that the final step doesn't really have a checksum, so if you make a mistake along the way (but not a bad enough one to screw up the message at the bottom), it could be quite hard to backtrack and fix things. My apologies if that caused you or your team any major headaches. Also, the logic here isn't very involved, but I thought that might be for the better, given the sheer size and scale of this puzzle, and I believe the poker setup doesn't lend itself to the most interesting logic, either... but I'd love to be proven wrong!</p>
