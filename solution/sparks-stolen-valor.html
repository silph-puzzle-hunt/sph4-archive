    <p>The following puzzles and answers feed into this metapuzzle:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>⭐ Alliance</td>
<td>FIREBIRD XL</td>

<tr>
<td>Whole New Ball Game</td>
<td>WISE ELDERS</td>

<tr>

<td>ZERO CHANCE</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of the feeders for this metapuzzle consists of two words. The first words of each feeder are synonymous with the name of a Valorant hero, as hinted by the flavortext ("When valor's the name of the game, her agents..."). As directed by the puzzle, we can sort the heroes by their canonical ordering on the official (English-language) Valorant website.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Puzzle answer</th>
<th>Valorant hero</th>
<th>Agent number</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SULFUR QUENCHING</td>
<td>Brimstone</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FIREBIRD XL</td>
<td>Phoenix</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WISE ELDERS</td>
<td>Sage</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SNAKE EGGPLANT</td>
<td>Viper</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ZERO CHANCE</td>
<td>Cypher</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OPENING CEREMONY</td>
<td>Breach</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SIGN CONVENTION</td>
<td>Omen</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Additionally, solvers might notice that the second words of the feeders tend to start with C or E. In fact, Valorant heroes each have abilities that are by default triggered by the keys Q, E, C, and X, allowing us to map each feeder to an ability. This is pointed at by the flavortext again ("key abilities"). The flavortext's mention of "go to any lengths" hints that lengths of some words are somehow important. Solvers might note that the last piece of information that isn't yet constrained is the lengths of the second words. Indeed, indexing into the ability names by these lengths spells out the meta answer: one way Spark can gain more control over the game (of Valorant) is to <strong>RUN RIOT</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>This was the first second-round meta I wrote for this hunt, after coming up with the pun and deciding it was too good to forego. I knew I could basically make it a pure meta, and I was pretty set on the word-to-agent association as a first step, so it was just a matter of how willing I was to overload the second words of answers with information. In the end, the meta tested pretty well despite the admittedly somewhat odd indexing mechanism, so it made the cut.</p>
<p>While writing this puzzle I ended up helping to overhaul the individual agent pages on the Valorant wiki to add (among other things) default move keys. Unfortunately, it turns out that Agent numbers are not well-defined, as some people may have discovered while solving this puzzle&mdash;the official English site has one numbering, but there's a separate numbering found in-game, which the wiki admins I spoke with decided to adopt instead and which I could not convince them to swap away from. To make matters worse, the non-English official sites had a <em>third</em> numbering. The hapless employee who answered my support ticket basically declared that they had no idea why this was the case either, and I decided to trade a little elegance for a massive simplification of my life with the inclusion of the official site note on the page.</p>
<p>Given that Valorant is constantly adding new agents, I was worried that they would randomly also decide to mess with the "official" ordering at some point. Thankfully, though they added a few agents (including the very lovely word of a name "Chamber" that came too late to be used), this didn't happen, and we made it through without disaster befalling this meta.</p>
<p>Finally, some answers that didn't make it through the construction process: HERB CRUSTED, SQUARE CUT, SPOILSPORT COP, FELL CAPTIVE, LEVEL EIGHT.</p>
