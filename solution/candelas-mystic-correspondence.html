    <p>The following puzzles and answers feed into this metapuzzle:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Puzzle title</th>
<th>Puzzle answer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>RED SUS</td>
<td>ENVIRONMENT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Minimeta That Goes Wrong</td>
<td>EXCEPT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Indirect Anagrams</td>
<td>FASTEN</td>

<tr>
<td>A Lot of Research into Things That Have Very Little Meaning</td>
<td>GROOVY</td>

<td>Audit Instance</td>
<td>SURMISE</td>

<td>White as a Sheet</td>
<td>WASTING</td>

<tr>
<td>Overdone</td>
<td>YEARNING</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The flavortext seems a little over-the-top, so it's a good place to start looking for progress. In particular, the "poetry about our teams coexisting" and the word "frosty" are meant to hint at a Robert Frost poem. In particular, the fitting poem for a puzzle about team Valor (associated with the Fire type) and team Mystic (associated with the Ice type) is Frost's poem <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice">Fire and Ice</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at this poem, we can note a few "correspondences" between the poem and our feeder answers; our feeder answers are synonyms of the words in the poem. This also helps to confirm that solvers have found the right poem. The table below gives these synonyms in the order the synonyms appear in the poem.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Puzzle answer</th>
<th>Poem synonym</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ENVIRONMENT</td>
<td>world</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>YEARNING</td>
<td>desire</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FASTEN</td>
<td>hold</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EXCEPT</td>
<td>but</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SURMISE</td>
<td>think</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WASTING</td>
<td>destruction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GROOVY</td>
<td>great</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the same vein of "correspondences", solvers might note, as clued by the flavortext's "through words, via letters" that there's exactly the same number of words in the poem as letters in our feeder answers. With the puzzle answers sorted in this order, we can line up the puzzle answers with the poem and read off the letters in our puzzle answers that correspond to the synonymous words in the poem.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Puzzle answer</th>
<th>Poem synonym</th>
<th>Corresponding words</th>
<th>Extracted letter</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ENVIRONMENT</td>
<td>world</td>
<td>Some say the <strong>world</strong> will end in fire, / Some say in</td>
<td>I</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>YEARNING</td>
<td>desire</td>
<td>ice. / From what I've tasted of <strong>desire</strong> / I</td>
<td>N</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FASTEN</td>
<td>hold</td>
<td><strong>hold</strong> with those who favor fire. /</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EXCEPT</td>
<td>but</td>
<td><strong>But</strong> if it had to perish</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SURMISE</td>
<td>think</td>
<td>twice, / I <strong>think</strong> I know enough of</td>
<td>R</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WASTING</td>
<td>destruction</td>
<td>hate / To say that for <strong>destruction</strong> ice /</td>
<td>N</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GROOVY</td>
<td>great</td>
<td>Is also <strong>great</strong> / And would suffice.</td>
<td>O</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And so we see the advice given to Candela: she should <strong>INFER NO</strong> from Blanche's frosty replies... or she could, perhaps, set things on fire.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>lydian first suggested this topic early on in the meta writing process, with a mechanic more tied to its intriguing rhyme scheme and with the pun INFER SNOW. I came up with this version of the meta and its pun a bit later. The original version, besides using the synonym mechanic, <em>also</em> gave the order of the feeder answers by having them start with the letters A to G instead of using the poem order; the day I came up with the puzzle idea, I thought I'd get out a rough draft and answer set in a few hours and send them off for a preliminary test. Five hours of construction attempts later, I still did not have a good set. I made up the word GOURMETED and sent it off for the idea to be reviewed by another editor, figuring that I'd find a good set later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after about 100 hours of manual search on my part, which mostly involved spending lunch breaks OneLooking, becoming so familiar with the dataset I could try permutations in my head, and really <em>really</em> wishing that AMBITION was one letter shorter than it actually was, I admitted defeat and went with this version of the puzzle, which is probably a bit cleaner in retrospect, since it only has one possible ordering of the feeders. One thing I do miss about the old version was that each puzzle answer didn't necessarily extract exactly one letter; this would have stopped teams from skipping the last correspondence by assuming that each answer extracts one letter and throwing all of the answers into a <a href="https://nutrimatic.org/?q=%22%5Benvironment%5D%5Byearning%5D%5Bfasten%5D%5Bexcept%5D%5Bsurmise%5D%5Bwasting%5D%5Bgroovy%5D%22">Nutrimatic query</a>, which we did hear happened a fair amount.</p>
<p>Perhaps more fascinatingly, at least one team came across another Frost poem, <a href="https://poets.org/poem/trial-existence">The Trial by Existence</a>, which not only matches with the coexistence mentioned in the flavortext but also, somehow, contains the words "valor" and "mystic". Hopefully teams didn't get stuck on this red herring for too long!</p>
