    <p>The most apparent point of entry to this puzzle should be the pairs of crossword clues below the grid. Though it doesn't look like any of them can be found directly in the grid, we can nonetheless solve them, as shown in the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Clue pair</th>
<th>Answer pair</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Bridge in San Francisco (6 4) / Souvenirs (9)</td>
<td>GOLDEN GATE / MEMENTOES</td>
</tr>

<td>RANCOROUS / STATIONARY</td>
</tr>

<td>Endorse (9) / What the P in AP classes stands for (9)</td>

<td>FLAGRANT FOUL / CUISINE</td>

<td>SUBMARINE / TRAGEDY</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Solvers might notice that there are nine pairs of clues and nine blank squares (or "openings") in the word search grid, implying some connection between the two. Perhaps by looking for answers in the grid, solvers might find some fragments of their crossword clue answers in the grid, most notably the "GOLD" going diagonally up and left from R7C13, or the "NT FOUL" going to the right from R9C2. Notably, these lines seem to pass through blank squares, with each answer pair sharing one blank square, as shown in the grid below.</p>
<p><center><img src=../static/puzzle_resources/solutions/opening-ceremony/grid_w.png height='481' width='530'></center></p>
<p>Since the answers found pass over blank squares, solvers might try placing the missing fragments of their answers into the blank squares. The two fragments from each word pair, when concatenated, give a string that is the name of a type of ceremony with one letter missing, tying in with the puzzle title. (Note that this missing letter might not be at the divide between the two fragments.) Reading these missing letters in order of the blank squares in the grid&mdash;left-to-right, top-to-bottom&mdash;spells out the puzzle answer <strong>BEGINNING</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>Besides it being a tradition by now, I think a gimmicked word search makes an ideal opening puzzle for a hunt like this one&mdash;it's a familiar puzzle type to almost every solver, there are obvious places to make progress, and it can get solvers thinking about how the puzzle follows or doesn't follow their pre-existing knowledge of the puzzle type (e.g. "all words can be found in the grid" against "the grid must be modified before the words can be found in it").</p>
<p>Due to spoiler-y reasons, we had already decided that the first puzzle in the hunt would be named Opening Ceremony, so I had to write this puzzle around its title, which was a new experience for me. The puzzle went through a few less interesting iterations before I finally landed on this design, which felt not entirely trivial but still interesting, quite clean, and thematic in a few ways. I hope it was a good welcoming party for the hunt, especially for less experienced solvers!</p>
