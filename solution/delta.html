<p>Many of the clues are ambiguous, but solvers should notice that the answers in each block seem to come from a small letter bank, which should help disambiguate some answers. In addition, all the clues are in alphabetical order within each block, suggesting that the answers in each block should be treated as an unordered set. Combining the two previous facts may prompt solvers to examine the frequency of letters within each block. In fact, the answers in each block always contain exactly 1 of some letter, 2 of some other letter, and so on. Solvers can also confirm this fact without solving all clues by observing that the total number of letters in every block is always a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">triangular number</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, the letters in order of their frequency always spell out a word. For example, in the first block:</p>
<div class="inner">
    Attraction with animals (3) <strong>ZOO</strong><br />
    Black-and-white cookie (4) <strong>OREO</strong><br />
    Make a mistake (3) <strong>ERR</strong><br /></div>

<p>Altogether, the answers consist of one Z, two E's, three R's, and four O's. In that order, those letters spell ZERO.</p>
<p>Each block can be resolved into a word in this way, resulting in the clues, which can be solved in the same way to get a set of answers with the same property: </p>
<table><tr><th>Clue</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tr><td>"ZERO", "MAPS" BAND (4 4 5)</td><td>YEAH YEAH YEAHS</td></tr><tr><td>OMAN REGION (6)</td><td>ARABIA</td></tr><tr><td>RANDOM (9)</td><td>ARBITRARY</td></tr><tr><td>ALPINE CRYPTID (4)</td><td>YETI</td></tr><tr><td>MONSTER TOMES (10)</td><td>BESTIARIES</td></tr><tr><td>BONE JOINT PROBLEM (14)</td><td>OSTEOARTHRITIS</td></tr><tr><td>SHOW OR VENT (3)</td><td>AIR</td></tr><tr><td>MORE FOGLIKE (7)</td><td>MISTIER</td></tr></table>

<p>These answers contain one M, two O's, three B's, four H's, five Y's, six S's, seven T's, eight E's, nine R's, ten I's, and eleven A's.</p>
<p>The answer, extracted in the same way, is <strong>MOB HYSTERIA</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>I wrote down this puzzle idea and the idea that became <a href="https://2018.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/everything-and-more.html">Everything and More</a>, from GPH 2018, almost at the same time; but avoided putting them in the same hunt since they have a fairly similar "flavor" of answer sets with weird letter distributions, and in particular have the same interesting cluing restriction that intermediate answers must have distinct letters. Brainstorming off this answer prompted me to dig this idea out since the answer is a pretty good fit for the obvious recursive structure: it's long, but consists of distinct letters and has a lot of common late vowels.</p>
<p>I thought this puzzle would be cheeseable just by anagramming unique letters without needing to count or even realize that letter frequencies were constrained, and some teams did solve all the first-round clues without ever noticing that the letter frequencies provided an ordering. However, it turns out the answer is not actually a common phrase ("mob mentality" and "mass hysteria", among others, are much more common) and barely pops out of anagramming tools at all! Nutrimatic has one barely-reasonable phrase, "BY AEROSMITH", which we saw a few times. So teams were largely forced to figure out the mechanic (possibly via a hint) in order to solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>The title for this puzzle was picked to be relatively uninformative without a lot of thought, as I wanted to keep the aha step pure based on the answers you'd obtain after solving some clues. Δ was just supposed to vaguely hint at the incremental difference betwen letter frequencies and, from another perspective, the triangular number of letters in the answers in each box. In hindsight, it may have been more distracting than helpful, as we saw a lot of teams looking at differences between words in their hint requests.</p>
