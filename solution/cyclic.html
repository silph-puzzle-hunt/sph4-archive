    <p>The clues are each encoded with a different substitution cipher. Deciphering these ciphers (perhaps by use of a cryptogram solver, like <a href="https://quipqiup.com/">quipqiup</a>), we receive nine questions, whose answers we can look up online, along with a rather strangely-worded instruction to index into "something". For now, there isn't anything else to index into, but we can index into our answers to get the extracted phrase SEE CYCLES.</p>

<p>But what cycles are there to see? The only thing we haven't used yet are the substitution ciphers, which could very well contain cycles of letter mappings. And, in fact, they do&mdash;each cipher contains one large cycle with most of the letters, appearing in alphabetical order, and one smaller cycle with a few letters. Focusing on the smaller cycles, we can see that the order they map to one another spells out a word for each cipher, like HAMSTER or BOXING.</p>
<p>In line with the puzzle, and perhaps with the original answers in mind, solvers might notice that some "cyclic" words can be appended to these words to make phrases that tie back to the original answers: for example, HAMSTER goes with WHEEL to associate with RUN FOREVER, and BOXING goes with RING to associate with ARENA.</p>

<p>It's also useful to recall the strange wording of the "index" statement from earlier, to index into "something". This lack of specificity indicates that the indices should be used again to index into something else; the most fitting target is the related cyclic phrase. Since each answer is related to another answer, we can set up one last cycle, going from one phrase to the next, as shown below:</p>

<p>We'll need to loop through the cycle a bit, since the extraction starts at a different point, but we can get our extracted letters to spell out C SIX H FIVE, fitting the (1 3 1 4) enumeration at the bottom of the page. This clues a (6 4) final answer; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> is the chemical formula for the phenyl group, which is also known&mdash;more thematically&mdash;as the <strong>PHENYL RING</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>In many puzzles I've seen that involve cryptogram-like substitution ciphers, the substitution cipher was mostly used like a black box: decipher it, find an answer, and re-encode your answer in the substitution cipher to get a new word. It's a nice idea, but it feels a little strange that a core mechanic of the puzzle should be used as such a shallow level. This puzzle was an attempt to introduce more meaning to the actual mechanics of the substitution cipher used, and I hope some teams found it interesting.</p>
