    <p>This puzzle comprises a selection of reports labelled with numbers, and a brief section of "broad categorization" clues at the bottom. We'll deal with what's at the top of the puzzle first; it seems difficult to identify what cities the reports might be discussing at first, we might notice that the report labels always comprise a letter and a number, with the letters ranging from A to M to provide an ordering. Doing so, and converting the numbers to letters via A1Z26, spells out CALVINO'S NOVEL. A brief search for novels by someone named Calvino brings up Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino. We can be pretty sure this is correct based on the general theme of cities and the title, which refers to vision and is also phonetically "IC", initializing both the book and its author.</p>
<p>Once solvers gain access to a copy of the book in some way, they can identify the cities by looking up particularly specific phrases or descriptions in the report texts. As it turns out, the number of question marks in the reports enumerates the name of each city, and the cities are arranged in alphabetical order, allowing for easier identification.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Report</th>
<th>City</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>G15</td>
<td>Anastasia</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H19</td>
<td>Baucis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E09</td>
<td>Beersheba</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can now take a look at the broad categorization clues at the bottom of the puzzle. Each of them has a 5-letter answer, and this 11-by-5 structure references the structure of the book itself, which describes 55 cities broken into 11 themes of 5 cities each. This allows us to associate each of our broad categorization answers with one of the themes in the book:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Clue</th>
<th>Answer</th>
<th>Pairing</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Male bovines</td>
<td>BULLS</td>
<td>BULLS [EYES]</td>

<tr>

<td>COSTS</td>
<td>[HIDDEN] COSTS</td>

<tr>
<td>One who might earn 10s when going under</td>
<td>DIVER</td>
<td>[SKY] DIVER</td>

<tr>
<td>Coming before all others</td>
<td>FIRST</td>
<td>FIRST [NAMES]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mathematical function that rounds down numbers</td>

<td>[TRADING] FLOOR</td>

<tr>
<td>It beats rock and Spock</td>
<td>PAPER</td>
<td>PAPER [THIN]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sequences of distinct edges, in graph theory</td>
<td>PATHS</td>
<td>[DESIRE] PATHS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It may be found in the mud</td>
<td>STICK</td>
<td>[MEMORY] STICK</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Execute by throwing rocks at</td>
<td>STONE</td>
<td>STONE [DEAD]</td>

<tr>
<td>Unable to relax</td>
<td>TENSE</td>
<td>[CONTINUOUS] TENSE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Absolutely essential or necessary</td>
<td>VITAL</td>
<td>VITAL [SIGNS]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, we note that each city has both an associated theme as well as an ordinal position within that theme—for example, Anastasia is the second city under the theme of Desire. For each city, we can extract the appropriate letter from the broad categorization answer linked to that theme, so Anastasia would extract A, the second letter of PATHS (from "desire paths"). Repeating this for every city and once again sorting by the given A-M report order gives the final answer SURVIVAL TOOLS.</p>

    <h5>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
    <p>When I was first introduced to this book by a friend, my first thought was, shamefully, "I should write a puzzle about this". Puzzling has made me incapable of appreciating great literature without turning it into a puzzle. That said, this is a pretty good book. Would recommend.</p>
